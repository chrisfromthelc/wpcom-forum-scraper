Do I have to make some additional steps to accelerate the process? Thanks for answering Hi there, Google typically takes about 6 weeks to begin indexing a site. Adding more articles in the meantime will help. Try writing about one book at a time, for example.Also, be sure to use words with your images as well: I noticed you added some book covers in a blog post. You might edit that, and click on each image to add a description for text-readers.Also, when you share links to the site, be sure to share the link to your page rather than to the editing page:We have more tips here: "}

{"topic_title": "Tags", "topic_url": "https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/tags-240/", "topic_messages_text": "Several months ago, I created , which currently has 27-Posts (Articles) that I have written\u2026all listed as \u2018Categories\u2019. My site is a Blog Site and for informational purposes directed to Retired U.S. Veterans / Currently Serving and Within 12-Months of Retiring. I was wondering with all the research that I have done to date, if there is anything that is in an easy to understand written format for me to use, to see how to convert my Categories to Tags?  Please note, that from what I have read thus far, several articles seem to point to SEOs and my website is not a .org but a .com, so I don\u2019t want any information that points to .org . Also, I am elderly and prefer to read an article with easy to understand show and tell photos as to what I am expected to do.  (NOTE: My daughter has a Blog Site as well and, she seems to think that my website is perfect the way it is with how I have everything listed but, I wish to get more exposure by trying to use Tags. So, I am open to any suggestions that anyone may be willing to provide.)Thanking you all ahead of time.Mabuhay US VeteransHi there,I\u2019d recommend adding a few tags to each post. No need to remove the category; that will work as a topic too: For more exposure, when you write a new post, ensure you\u2019re using a few tags and a category that go best with the post. And if you want more SEO tips specific to your site here at WordPress.com, I\u2019d recommend this: As well as the tips on getting seen / getting connected here: Hoping this helps!Supernovia,Thanks for your response.I read through most of the WordPress.com Sites as to how this is supposedly all accomplished and yet (as a Senior Citizen \u2013 70+), I fail to grasp how this is all accomplished.  I work best with visual (not YouTube Videos) written articles with supporting graphics as to how this is all accomplished. A young lady who commented on how much she liked my WordPress.com Articles said, I could post tags \u201cprior to the article being posted\u201d and yet, I don\u2019t see how that is possible until the article is actually posted. Yet, what you provided stated that same thing and I quote: \u201cAdd up to 15 relevant tags and categories (total) to your posts before you hit publish, and your content will appear on those tag pages\u201d, end of quote. So, how do I go about adding Tags to categories that are already posted?Thanks for the idea of \u201cNo need to remove the category\u201d, as that is very much appreciated.Also, as far as I have read, SEOs can only be used for those that have a Business Account, which I don\u2019t have, as I am just trying to keep this simple, using Facebook as a Social Media Platform to have U.S. Veterans go to and are automatically referred to my WordPress.com Website. Those that have already seen my Facebook Site, are made aware of updated posts showing on my WordPress.com site.The young lady who liked my posts thus far, even went as far to say, that I should try \u201cPinterest\u201d to advertise but, that too requires a Business Account.  My daughter seems to think that \u201cPinterest\u201d is primarily used by Women and not so much by Retired U.S. Veterans, so that most likely is not the correct avenue to take either.Any other ideas would be very much appreciated.Thanking you ahead of time.Mabuhay US VeteransP.S. If I don\u2019t respond back in a timely fashion, that is because the internet is extremely poor to non-existent here in the Philippines and, has been this way ever since 3/18/2020 when the Pandemic first got started.  Hi there,So first, it\u2019s good to understand the difference between categories and tags.Use categories to organise your site \u2013 if you write about specific main topics, you\u2019d use a category for each of those. Ideally the same post won\u2019t appear under two or three categories, max. This isn\u2019t a rule, but it\u2019s considered best practice.Currently you have only one category, Blog. Technically all posts you publish form part of your blog, so consider using categories that are a bit more descriptive of the topics you post about.Tags are  keywords. So within the category, what are the five or six keywords that represent the post for you. (You can add up to 15 tags and categories combined, but that\u2019s a limit, not a target :) )For tags, try to stick to a single word. For categories you can be a bit more descriptive, but still keep it short.Go to My Site ->Site ->Posts and edit a post. Then look for the Categories and Tags section in the editor sidebar. There you can add tags, create new categories, or assign an existing category to the post. You can do this both when creating a new post, or when editing an existing one. The link below is a short animation showing these steps:You can find the written instructions here:You\u2019ll notice that if the post already has a category selected, you can unselect it and select/add a different category.You can also edit an existing category. That\u2019s done from Settings:The Business Plan includes some special SEO tools, but SEO applies to all sites. SEO simply refers to how your site is configured to allow search engines to discover it. So all WordPress.com sites are automatically configured for SEO. The Business Plan just gives you a bit more control over those settings.The page  linked to just contains some details on what you can do to make your content more search-engine friendly. There is no need to upgrade to Business to follow most of those tips :)You don\u2019t need any WordPress.com upgrade to promote your site on Pinterest, no. You just need your own Pinterest account. Then you can share new blog posts on your site by pasting the post link into a new Pin in that app.You can also add a Pinterest sharing button to your site. Then sharing your post to Pinterest is as simple as clicking that button, and it allows other people to share your posts to their Pinterest boards as well.We have buttons for all the most popular social media services.This is a lot of info, so please let us know if you have any more questions. Threads stay open for at least a month before they\u2019re closed automatically, and we\u2019ll see any new replies you add to this thread automatically, so you can reply whenever you\u2019re ready :)Kokkish,WOW, am I ever impressed!  Thanks for your excellent response, as I am quite impressed with what you provided to me and, saw the same instructions at my end in your email response to me too. Now, I have something that I can actually refer to, by glancing down at when entering in the information that you presented to me, for future reference.If I have any further questions, I will get back with yourself but, I am fairly sure at this point in time, that I might not, with all the information that you provided to me.Respectfully,Mabuhay US VeteransI\u2019m glad I could help :)If you have any more questions you know where to find us.kokkiehJust wanted to get back with you and, thank you very much.  While the internet was cooperating this morning (Money here in the Philippines), I was able to unpublish, add several tags to three of my 26-posts (as you described how to do in great detail) and, everything worked perfectly.So once again, a big resounding thank you for a job well done!We can now consider this Subject Post to be closed.Respectfully,Mabuhay US Veterans"}
